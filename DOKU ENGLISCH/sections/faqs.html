		<h4><a name="rewrite-rule-missing-error" id="rewrite-rule-missing-error"></a>A server error is being displayed (e.g. a 404 error).</h4>
		
		<p>This is most likely caused by the person installing the software not having added a working Rewrite Rule.</p>
		
		<p>As is mentioned in the <a href="configuration.html#rewrite-rule">Setting up a Rewrite Rule</a> section of the documentation, a RewriteRule needs to be added for the store, either to a .htaccess file or a VirtualHost Directive.</p>
		
		<p>Follow the instructions in the <a href="configuration.html#rewrite-rule">Setting up a Rewrite Rule</a> section of the documentation.</p>
		
		<p>If that doesn't help, then, this kind of issue is something that is outside the scope of this documentation. There are plenty of guides to be found on the internet on how to configure a server properly for Rewrite handling.</p>

		<h4><a name="rewrite-rule-error" id="rewrite-rule-error"></a>A server error is being displayed (e.g. a &ldquo;Bad Request&rdquo; error).</h4>
		
		<p>This is most likely caused by using the wrong path to &ldquo;index.php&rdquo; being used in the <code>RewriteRule</code> directive or by other rewrite rules on the server interfering with the rule being used for the Ceon URI Mapping module.</p>
		
		<ul class="BulletedList">
			<li>If putting the rule in a <span class="FileName">.htaccess</span> file, then care needs to be taken with the location of the file and the final path to <code>index.php</code> being used in the <code>RewriteRule</code> directive.</li>
			<li>If putting the rule in a <strong>VirtualHost directive</strong>, the <code>RewriteRule</code> will need to have the relative path to the Zen Cart directory prepended to <code>index.php</code>.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<ul class="Steps">
			<li>
				<p>If putting the rule in a <span class="FileName">.htaccess</span> file, make sure the <strong>directory</strong> the shop is in (e.g. &ldquo;shop/&rdquo;) is before <code>index.php</code> in the last line of the Rewrite Rule. That may fix things!</p>
				<p>For example, the line may end up looking as follows (<strong>note that there's no slash at the beginning of the shop's directory name</strong>):</p>
				<p><code>RewriteRule .* shop/index.php?%{QUERY_STRING} [L]</code></p>
			</li>
			<li class="NoMarginBottom">
				<p>If that doesn't work, try putting a slash in front of the path to the index.php file.</p>
				<p>For example, the line may end up looking like one of the following:</p>
				<p><code>RewriteRule .* /index.php?%{QUERY_STRING} [L]</code></p>
				<p class="NoMarginBottom"><code>RewriteRule .* /shop/index.php?%{QUERY_STRING} [L]</code></p>
			</li>
		</ul>
		
		<ul class="Steps">
			<li class="NoMarginBottom">
				<p>If putting the rule in a <strong>VirtualHost directive</strong>, try adding the <strong>relative path</strong> to the shop (e.g. &ldquo;/&rdquo; or &ldquo;/shop/&rdquo;) before <code>index.php</code> in the last line of the Rewrite Rule and restart the webserver. Depending on your version of Apache, that may fix things!</p>
				<p>For example, the line may end up looking as follows:</p>
				<p class="NoMarginBottom"><code>RewriteRule .* /shop/index.php?%{QUERY_STRING} [L]</code></p>

		<h4><a name="relative-path-issues" id="relative-path-issues"></a>When Ceon URI Mapping is enabled images stop appearing on the site!</h4>
		
		<p>Ceon URI Mapping enables a site to use static URIs.</p>
		
		<p>For a site to work with static URIs, <strong>all paths</strong> on the site must be <strong>relative to the site's root</strong>, NOT to the current page!</p>
		
		<p>These are often known as &ldquo;absolute&rdquo; paths.</p>
		
		<p>The site's root is &ldquo;/&rdquo;. E.g. <code>http://storesite.com/</code>.</p>
		
		<p>There are several things that can be done to make sure this happens.</p>
		
		<ul class="Steps">
			<li>
				<p>First off, make sure that the site has a <code>&lt;base href=&quot;http://storesite.com/&quot; /&gt;</code> tag set in the Zen Cart header file.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>This tag <strong>must come before</strong> any tags that load in CSS or JavaScript files.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>The tag is normally added by Zen Cart to the file <span class="FileName">includes/templates/template_default/common/html_header.php</span>.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>If the store uses a custom template, it may be using a file <span class="FileName">includes/templates/STORE-TEMPLATE/common/html_header.php</span>.</p>
			</li>
			<li class="NoMarginBottom">
				<p class="NoMarginBottom">Make sure that the <code>&lt;base href=&quot;...</code> tag is present in one of the files the store uses - unfortunately some template creators, unprofessionally, accidentally leave out this essential tag.</p>
			</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>If that doesn't fix things, then individual paths may need to be changed from relative paths to absolute paths.</p>
		
		<ul class="Steps">
			<li class="NoMarginBottom">
				<p>Use paths that go right from the root to their final file.</p>
				<p>For example, instead of a CSS file using a relative link to an image like:</p>
				<p><code>url(../images/some-image-name.png)</code></p>
				<p>Use a full, absolute path such as:</p>
				<p class="NoMarginBottom"><code>url(/includes/templates/STORE-TEMPLATE/images/some-image-name.png)</code></p>
				
			</li>

		<h4><a name="relative-path-issues-layout" id="relative-path-issues-layout"></a>When Ceon URI Mapping is enabled, the site's layout is messed up!</h4>
		
		<p>This is the same issue that is covered in <a href="#relative-path-issues">this FAQ</a>.</p>
		
		<p class="BackToTableOfContents"><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>
	</li>
	
	<li>
		<h4><a name="relative-path-issues-modules" id="relative-path-issues-modules"></a>When Ceon URI Mapping is enabled, a module on the site doesn't work properly! (E.g. Dynamic menus/popups etc. stop working)</h4>
		
		<p>This is <strong>quite likely</strong> to be a similar issue to that covered in <a href="#relative-path-issues">this FAQ</a>.</p>
		
		<p class="Underlined">Try reading and applying what is mentioned in that FAQ first.</p>
		
		<p>If the information in that FAQ doesn't enable you to fix things:</p>
		
		<ul class="Steps">
			<li>If the module uses JavaScript/AJAX, check any JavaScript to make sure that it isn't expecting the current page's URI always to be the root of the store (e.g. http://storesite.com/shop/).</li>
			
			<li>As static URIs appear to be like &ldquo;subfolders&rdquo; to modules written using JavaScript, the module may need to be recoded to work with static URIs.</li>
		
			<li class="NoMarginBottom">This can be done by having paths within the software built from the root of the store and not relative to the current &ldquo;subfolder&rdquo; on the site, as static URIs break the idea of a site having folders in the URI.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>If that doesn't enable you to fix things:</p>
		
		<ul class="Steps">
			<li>Check the module's code to see if it uses the <code>$_SERVER['REQUEST_URI']</code> variable.</li>
			
			<li>As the use of static URIs means that the Zen Cart query string parameters are no longer present in <code>$_SERVER['REQUEST_URI']</code>, any code which checks against them in this variable will fail, and therefore needs to be rewritten to work with a Zen Cart that uses static URIs.</li>
		
			<li class="NoMarginBottom">
				<p>For example, if the code used a test such as:</p>
				<p><code>strstr($_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'], 'create_account')</code></p>
				<p>It could be changed to:</p>
				<p class="NoMarginBottom"><code>$_GET['main_page'] == 'create_account'</code></p>
			</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>If none of the above helps, then, this kind of issue is something that is outside the scope of this documentation.</p>
		<p class="Note"><strong>Please Note:</strong> If you attempt to contact Ceon directly about any such issues you may be required to pay for any support given, as outlined in the <a href="support.html">support documentation</a>.</p>

		<h4><a name="file-extensions-blocked" id="file-extensions-blocked"></a>When the rewrite rule for Ceon URI Mapping is added, some file types on the site are blocked or showing up as 404s!</h4>
		
		<p>Information about preventing problems with Ceon URI Mapping &ldquo;blocking&rdquo; certain file types can found in <a href="configuration.html#prevent-rewriting-of-file-extensions">the configuration documentation</a>.</p>
		
		<p class="BackToTableOfContents"><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>

	<li>
		<h4><a name="session-id" id="session-id"></a>A session parameter (like &ldquo;<code>?zenid=XXXX</code>&rdquo;) is being added to the end of the store's URIs.</h4>
		
		<p>Zen Cart adds a session ID to the end of all links on the very first page that a user visits.</p>
		<p>This is because when the user first arrives, no cookie has been set in their browser, so Zen Cart must assume that cookies are not enabled, and therefore it adds something like &ldquo;<code>?zenid=XXXX</code>&rdquo; to the end of all the links/URIs on the first page visited.</p>
		<p>There is no way to avoid this; however <strong>it is not a problem</strong>!</p>
		<p>Ceon URI Mapping has full Canonical URI support built in, so the search engines don't see the &ldquo;<code>?zenid=XXXX</code>&rdquo; bit at all and the site is not penalised in any way.</p>
		<p>It may not look as nice as you'd like but it only appears for the first page and, as has just been said <strong>this is unavoidable - just ignore it</strong>!</p>
		
		<p class="BackToTableOfContents"><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>
	</li>
	
	<li>
		<h4><a name="linked-products" id="linked-products"></a>A string beginning with &ldquo;<code>?cPath</code>&rdquo; is being added to the end of a product's URI.</h4>
		
		<p>The module retains Zen Cart's category history when linking to a linked product which is not within its &ldquo;master&rdquo; category, so the full path back through any parent categories is available. To do so, it is essential that the &ldquo;<code>cpath</code>&rdquo; query string parameter is added to the URI.</p>
		<p>Without this feature all linked products would always show as belonging to their &ldquo;master&rdquo; category, which will not be the category the customer has accessed the product from.. this would make it appear to the customer that they had &ldquo;jumped&rdquo; to another part of the site, they would no longer be in the same category they were in previously!</p>
		<p>There is no way to avoid the <code>cPath</code> parameter being added for linked products. It's advised to use linked products only when necessary and/or to simply accept that it's not possible in Zen Cart to omit the <code>cPath</code> parameter in the URI of linked products.</p>

		<h4><a name="rewrite-rule-blocking-addresses" id="rewrite-rule-blocking-addresses"></a>After adding the rewrite rule access to part of the site (e.g. the site's control panel) is being blocked.</h4>

		<h4><a name="missing-config-group-option" id="missing-config-group-option"></a>The software is installed but there is no &ldquo;Ceon URI Mapping (SEO)&rdquo; option in the store's &ldquo;Configuration&rdquo; menu.</h4>
		
		<p>It is essential that there is a section in the &ldquo;Configuration&rdquo; menu of the store's Zen Cart admin called &ldquo;Ceon URI Mapping (SEO)&rdquo;.</p>
		
		<p>If this configuration group and option is missing Ceon URI Mapping will show and work within the Zen Cart admin but will <strong>not be enabled in the store</strong> - standard Zen Cart dynamic URIs will be used!</p>
		
		<p>For some reason, some servers fail to add the configuration group and option when installing Ceon URI Mapping.</p>
		
		<p>This can hopefully be fixed by the following...</p>
		
		<ul class="Steps">
			<li>
				<p>Go to <em>Modules &gt; Ceon URI Mapping (SEO) Config</em> in the Zen Cart Admin.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Then go to the <em>Installation Check</em> tab and click on the link to open the Installation Check utility page.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>The module will now automatically carry out the installation check.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>If any errors are listed, follow the instructions given by the software.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Now go <strong>back</strong> to <em>Modules &gt; Ceon URI Mapping (SEO) Config</em> in the Zen Cart Admin.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Go back to the <em>Installation Check</em> tab and click on the link to run the configuration checker.</p>
			</li>
			<li class="NoMarginBottom">
				<p class="NoMarginBottom">If any problems are found with the configuration, the software should hopefully be able to fix the problems.</p>
			</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>If this does not fix things then there is simply something wrong with the server/site itself.</p>
