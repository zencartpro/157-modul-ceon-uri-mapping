		<h4>Remove the old file used by the previously installed version of the module</h4>
		
		<p>Since the module had been rewritten (for Zen Cart Version 1.5.5 and above) to minimize core file modification, many of the old files were no longer used and <strong>needed to be removed/modified</strong>.

		<h4>Modify an additional Zen Cart Core File</h4>
		
		<p>Based on your Zen Cart Version (1.5.4 and below) an additional core Zen Cart file should be modified, to add the new support for outputting static URIs instead of dynamic URIs in Zen Cart's admin.</p>
		
		<ul class="BulletedList">
			<li>
				<p>It is likely that this file has not been modified for the store already, in which case it should be possible to simply <em class="Underlined">back up the file</em> and then overwrite the file with the pre-modified sample file from this distribution, for the version of Zen Cart being used by the store.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>However, if the core file has also been modified for the store <strong class="Underlined">for other third party modules</strong>, the changes within the sample file included in this distribution must be applied <strong>carefully</strong> to the core file.</p>
				
				<p>The changes are clearly marked within the sample file in the distribution and should be easy enough to copy across, especially if a &ldquo;diff&rdquo; software package (such as the free WinMerge or the excellent, commercial, Beyond Compare) is used.</p>
				
				<p>Instructions on how to copy across the modifications necessary for this module - to the core file which has previously been modified - can be found <a href="faqs.html#modifying-core-files">in this FAQ</a>.</p>

<h2><a name="upgrading-from-version-2-or-3" id="upgrading-from-version-2-or-3"></a>Upgrading to Ceon URI Mapping 5.1.0 from Ceon URI Mapping 2.x/3.x</h2>
<p>Ceon URI Mapping 4.x is a complete rewrite of the software.</p>
<p>Upgrading from an earlier version to 5.1.0 will take a little bit of time, but is easy to do.</p>
<p>The great thing is that once you've upgraded, not only will the software be better, but version 5.1.0 has a completely new file structure, and auto-upgrading functionality, which means that any subsequent upgrades (to 5.1.0, 4.2.2 etc.) will take just a few <strong class="Underlined">seconds</strong>!</p>
<p>So once v5.1.0 is installed, it'll be simple to keep up to date and to keep getting all the extra features new versions provide!</p>

<ol class="InstallationSteps">
	<li>
		<h4>Remove the old files used by the previously installed version of the module</h4>

		<h4>Update the Zen Cart Core Files used by Ceon URI Mapping</h4>
		
		<p><strong class="Underlined">All</strong> of the core Zen Cart files that were modified for the previously installed version must be updated to work with the new version.</p>
		
		<p>There are also some additional files which need to be modified.</p>
		
		<p>As is mentioned above, this will take a little time, but subsequent versions of the software are unlikely to require further core file modifications so it's important to &ldquo;get this step over and done with&rdquo;.</p>
		
		<ul class="BulletedList">
			<li>
				<p>If these files were only modified when installing a previous version of Ceon URI Mapping, then it should be possible to simply <em class="Underlined">back up each file</em> and then simply overwrite the file with the pre-modified sample file from this distribution, for the version of Zen Cart being used by the store.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>However, if any of these core files have also been modified for the store <strong class="Underlined">for other third party modules</strong>, the changes within the sample files included in this distribution must be applied <strong>carefully</strong> to the core files.</p>
				<p>The changes are clearly marked within the sample files in the distribution and should be easy enough to copy across, especially if a &ldquo;diff&rdquo; software package (such as the free WinMerge or the excellent, commercial, Beyond Compare) is used.</p>
				
				<ul class="BulletedList">
					<li>
						<p>Most of the changes between earlier versions are made at the exact same place as they were previously, so it should be quite easy to &ldquo;merge&rdquo; the updated code.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>Don't forget though that some of the files to be modified were not modified for previous versions, so no existing Ceon URI Mapping code will be present in those files.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>Also, take care to note the numbers in the &ldquo;marker comments&rdquo; (1 of X) - for some files there are now <strong>fewer</strong> modifications than there were previously, so some modifications will also have to be removed when adding the updated modifications.</p>
					</li>
				</ul>
				
				<p>Instructions on how to copy across the modifications necessary for this module - to the version of the respective core files which have previously been modified - can be found <a href="faqs.html#modifying-core-files">in this FAQ</a>.</p>
				
			</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h5>Modified core files for the Admin directory (Primarily for Zen Cart Version 1.5.4 and below)</h5>
		
		<p class="Note"><strong>Please Note</strong>: If copying the files across, and the admin folder for the store is not named &ldquo;admin&rdquo;, then care must be taken to place the files from within the <span class="FileName">modified_core_files/ZC-version/admin</span> folder into the <strong>store's</strong> admin folder. Simply copying across the <span class="FileName">modified_core_files/ZC-version/admin</span> folder won't work!</p>
		
		<p>If any of the &ldquo;Product Types&rdquo; (e.g. Document General or Product Book) aren't used by the store, there's no real need to copy/modify the files in the respective directories (e.g. document_general or product_book). However, error messages will be displayed in the &ldquo;Installation Check&rdquo; if it detects unmodified files, so it is best to just take a minute or two and make the modifications now anyway.</p>

		<h5>Modified core files for the main store directory</h5>
		
		<p>Some versions of Zen Cart require modifications that others don't. Just apply the modifications to files that are present in the <em class="FileName">modified_core_files</em> folder for the version of Zen Cart the store uses.</p>
		
		<p>If a file doesn't exist in the overrides directory, simply copy the pre-modified sample file from this distribution, for the version of Zen Cart being used by the store, into the overrides folder.</p>

		<h4><span class="WeightNormal">[Upgrading From Ceon URI Mapping 2.0.0 - 3.6.3]</span> Remove Old Core File Modifications</h4>
		
		<p>If the store is upgrading from version prior to 3.8.0 then there are some Zen Cart core files which will have been modified for the previous version but which no longer require any modifications.</p>
		
		<p>It is advised that these modifications are removed:</p>
		
		<ul class="BulletedList">
			<li class="NoMarginBottom">
				<p>The files <span class="FileName">admin/includes/modules/delete_product_confirm.php</span> and <span class="FileName">admin/includes/modules/product_music/delete_product_confirm.php</span> no longer need to be modified.</p>
				<p>The modifications can be removed by editing these files and removing all the code including and between the <code>// BEGIN CEON URI MAPPING 1 of 1</code> markers, or, if the files have <strong>not been modified for any other third party module</strong>, by copying over the files with &ldquo;fresh&rdquo; versions from the original Zen Cart distribution for the version of Zen Cart the store uses.</p>
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	
	<li>
		<h4><span class="WeightNormal">[Upgrading From Ceon URI Mapping 2.0.0 - 3.4.3]</span> Template Files For Zen Cart 1.3.x</h4>
		
		<p>This upgrade step doesn't apply for stores already using version 3.6.0 or later.</p>
		
		<p>A few of the standard Zen Cart template files require modifications to work with this module as they weren't built in a way that supports static URIs.</p>
		<p>Modifications to existing template files, for static URIs to be able to be used by some of the standard Zen Cart sideboxes and by the product listing filter forms, have been made to &ldquo;clean&rdquo; copies of the template files from a &ldquo;fresh&rdquo; installation of Zen Cart and are included as &ldquo;sample&rdquo; files in this distribution.</p>
		
		<ul class="BulletedList">
			<li>
				<p>If any of these template files <strong>haven't</strong> already been modified for the store, the sample files included in this distribution can be copied into the store's template directory and will then override the standard versions of the files included in the Zen Cart distribution.</p></li>
			<li>
				<p>If any of these template files <strong>have</strong> already been modified for the store, then the changes necessary to support the use of static URIs must be made to the store's modified file(s). The changes are clearly marked within the sample files in the distribution and should be easy enough to copy across, especially if a &ldquo;diff&rdquo; software package (such as the free WinMerge or the excellent, commercial, Beyond Compare) is used.</p>
				<p>Instructions on how to copy across the modifications necessary for this module - to template files which have previously been modified - can be found <a href="faqs.html#modifying-template-files">in this FAQ</a>.</p></li>
		
		</ul>
		
		<p>The sample template files can be found within the <span class="FileName">template_override_files</span> folder in the distribution. They are:</p>
		
		<ul class="Steps">

		<h4><span class="WeightNormal">[Zen Cart Versions 1.3.0 - 1.3.8 Only]</span> Enable Canonical URI Support</h4>
		
		<p>This upgrade step doesn't apply for stores using Zen Cart version 1.3.9 or 1.5.0.</p>
		
		<p>Canonical URI support is an absolutely <strong>essential</strong> feature of this module, so it must be enabled properly.</p>
		
		<p>If it isn't, search engines will penalise the site and it may well drop down in its rankings!</p>
		
		<p>Zen Cart versions 1.3.9 and 1.5.0 have the necessary canonical code built into them already but previous versions of Zen Cart must have a file modified to add this support.</p>
		
		<p>The file <span class="FileName">includes/templates/STORE-TEMPLATE/common/html_header.php</span> must be modified.</p>
		
		<ul class="BulletedList">
			<li>
				<p>If the template file <span class="FileName">includes/templates/STORE-TEMPLATE/common/html_header.php</span> does not yet exist, then simply copy across the file from the <span class="FileName">template_override_files</span> folder for the version of Zen Cart the store is using.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>If the template file <span class="FileName">includes/templates/STORE-TEMPLATE/common/html_header.php</span> does exist for the store, then the simple change necessary for canonical URI support must be made to the store's <span class="FileName">html_header.php</span>.</p>
				<p>The change is clearly marked within the sample file in the distribution and should be easy enough to copy across, especially if a &ldquo;diff&rdquo; software package (such as the free WinMerge or the excellent, commercial, Beyond Compare) is used.</p>
				<p>Instructions on how to copy across the modifications necessary for this module - to existing template files - can be found <a href="faqs.html#modifying-template-files">in this FAQ</a>.</p></li>

	</li>
	
	<li>
		<h4>Automatically update the database and configuration</h4>
		
		<p>This software comes with some intelligent upgrade and error checking functionality which makes it easy to keep the database and configuration up to date.</p>
		
		<ul class="Steps">
			<li class="NoMarginBottom">
				<p class="NoMarginBottom">Go to <em>Modules &gt; Ceon URI Mapping (SEO) Config</em> in the Zen Cart Admin and the module will be updated automagically!</p>
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	
	<li>
		<h4>Check/Adjust the New Auto-manage Settings for Products' &ldquo;Reviews&rdquo; and &ldquo;Tell-A-Friend&rdquo; pages</h4>
		
		<p>This new version of the software has completely rewritten functionality for managing the URI mappings of &ldquo;Product Related Pages&rdquo;, such as the various &ldquo;Reviews&rdquo; pages and the &ldquo;Tell-A-Friend&rdquo; pages.</p>
		
		<p>In versions prior to 4.0.0, a bug in the software meant that the URI mappings being built for these pages only worked correctly for sites using one language.</p>
		
		<p>For stores that support multiple languages, it is <strong>essential</strong> to configure the new &ldquo;Auto-managed Product Page URIs&rdquo; settings.</p>
		
		<p>Even for stores that don't multiple languages, it is <strong>highly recommended</strong> to check these settings as, if the store doesn't use any of the &ldquo;Reviews&rdquo; or &ldquo;Tell-A-Friend&rdquo; pages, the settings can be changed so that the store's URI Mapping database doesn't fill up with lots of unused URI Mappings - this makes the <em class="Underlined">software faster and more efficient</em>, minimising preventable slowdown of the site!</p>
		
		<ul class="Steps">
			<li>
				<p>Go to <em>Modules &gt; Ceon URI Mapping (SEO) Config</em> in the Zen Cart Admin.</p>
			</li>
			<li class="NoMarginBottom">
				<p class="NoMarginBottom">Then go to the <em>Auto-managed Product Page URIs</em> tab, adjust the settings appropriately for the store, and click &ldquo;Save&rdquo;.</p>
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	
	<li>
		<h4>Run the Installation Check</h4>
		
		<p>This new version of the software comes with an amazingly handy Installation Check utility.</p>
		
		<p>The installation check will examine the store's configuration files and warn you about any mistakes in the files which you need to correct, and will even provide full information about what you should do.</p>
		
		<p>It will also check all the core files that must be modified for Ceon URI Mapping to work optimally, and warn you if any of the modifications are missing or out of date, again giving information on what you should do!</p>
		
		<p>A quick glance at this new admin page should help you identify and fix any problems with the installation quickly and easily!</p>
		
		<ul class="Steps">
			<li>
				<p>Go to <em>Modules &gt; Ceon URI Mapping (SEO) Config</em> in the Zen Cart Admin.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Then go to the <em>Installation Check</em> tab and click on the link to open the Installation Check utility page.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>The module will now automatically carry out the installation check.</p>
			</li>
			<li class="NoMarginBottom">
				<p class="NoMarginBottom">If any errors are listed, follow the instructions given by the software.</p>
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	
	<li>
		<h4><span class="WeightNormal">[OPTIONAL but RECOMMENDED]</span> Update the Rewrite Rule</h4>
		
		<p>The suggested &ldquo;Example&rdquo; Rewrite Rule supplied with this distribution has been further optimised, and should result in [slight, but welcome] performance gains for sites using the new format.</p>
		
		<p>To make things as easy as possible, this new version of the software comes with handy new &ldquo;Example Rewrite Rule&rdquo; functionality.</p>
		
		<p>The module will analyse the filesystem on the server and attempt to build a rewrite rule for the store that has any necessary exclusions added.</p>
		
		<ul class="Steps">
			<li>
				<p>Go to <em>Modules &gt; Ceon URI Mapping (SEO) Config</em> in the Zen Cart Admin.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Then go to the <em>Installation Check</em> tab and click on the link to open the Installation Check utility page.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Since any errors with the store's configuration files should have been fixed after running the installation check in the previous step, the &ldquo;Example Rewrite Rule&rdquo; panel will be displayed.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Read the instructions given in that panel and copy and paste the new Rewrite Rule to the store's .htaccess file/VirtualHost directive, if desired.</p>
			</li>
			<li class="NoMarginBottom">
				<p class="NoMarginBottom">Remember this is just an <strong>Example</strong> rewrite rule, and although it's likely to be better than that used for a previous version of the software, it will not have any customisations made by whoever added the original rewrite rule... so be sure to carefully merge the changes as appropriate - this is your responsibility!</p>
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	
	<li>
		<h4><span class="WeightNormal">[OPTIONAL but RECOMMENDED]</span> Configure the Google Sitemap (XML) Module</h4>
		
		<p>If the store uses the Google Sitemap module, it needs to be configured to work better with static URIs.</p>
		
		<p>Otherwise, the store's rankings may be penalised because of links in the sitemap redirecting to other links.</p>
		
		<ul class="Steps">
			<li>
				<p>Go to <em>Configuration &gt; Sitemap XML</em> in the Zen Cart Admin.</p>
			</li>
			<li class="NoMarginBottom">
				<p class="NoMarginBottom">Make sure that &ldquo;Generate language_id for default language&rdquo; is set to &ldquo;false&rdquo;.</p>
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	
	<li>
		<h4><span class="WeightNormal">[OPTIONAL but RECOMMENDED]</span> Take a note of the FAQs</h4>
		
		<p>Lots of people ask us the same questions. It's worth reading the FAQs.</p>
		
		<p>At the very least, here are some of the most popular questions that are covered:</p>
		
		<ul class="BulletedList">
			<li><a href="faqs.html#session-id" target="_blank">A session parameter (like &ldquo;<code>?zenid=XXXX</code>&rdquo;) is being added to the end of the store's URIs.</a></li>
			<li><a href="faqs.html#linked-products" target="_blank">A string beginning with &ldquo;<code>?cPath</code>&rdquo; is being added to the end of a product's URI.</a></li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	
	<li>
		<h4>That's it!</h4>
		
		<p>It may have taken a wee while this time, but the above should all have been fairly easy to do. And the new Installation Check certainly helps!</p>
		
		<p>As mentioned previously, that's likely to be the last involved upgrade of this software... upgrading to subsequent versions will most likely just be a matter of overwriting some files, taking only a few seconds.</p>
		
		<p>Enjoy the new version of the software, there are hundreds of hours of work in it and we hope you like all the new/improved functionality!</p>
