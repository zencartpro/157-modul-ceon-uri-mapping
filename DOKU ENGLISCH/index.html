	<h3>Product / Category / Manufacturer Rates</h3>
	<p>The Ceon Advanced Shipper module allows <strong>individual products</strong> and/or <strong>entire product categories</strong> and/or <strong>all products from specific manufacturer(s)</strong> to have their own specific <em>shipping rates</em>!</p>
	<p>There is no limit on the number of <em>method</em>s which can be defined, <em>products</em>/<em>categories</em>/<em>manufacturers</em>/<em>the whole store</em> can have multiple <em>shipping method</em>s if desired (E.g. &ldquo;Royal Mail 2nd Class&rdquo;, &ldquo;Royal Mail Next Day&rdquo; etc.)!</p>
	<p>If there are various shipping options for the items within a customer's shopping cart, they are presented with all possible combinations of shipping methods for those items, so they can choose the method (combination) that best suits them!</p>
	<p class="Example">For example, if a customer has a magazine in their cart as well as a bookcase, they can be offered the following options, which let them choose between normal or express delivery for the magazine while having the bookcase shipped via a pallet service:
		<br /><img src="_images/advanced-shipper-screenshots/method-comb-example.png" alt="Example of Shipping Method Combinations being offered to customer at checkout." class="ExampleScreenshot NoMarginBottom" /></p>
	<p>Being able to specify exactly which products/categories/manufacturers use which method(s) makes it very easy indeed to set up almost any type of shipping arrangement, including <strong>complex drop-shipping arrangements</strong> etc., something most/all other Zen Cart shipping modules can't do.</p>
	<p>In fact, <strong>very few</strong> shopping cart software packages, commercial and/or open source, can match Ceon Advanced Shipper's functionality as integrated with Zen Cart, never mind its <strong>ease of use</strong>!</p>


	<h3>Flexible Region Definitions</h3>
	<p>There are multiple mechanisms for defining <em>Shipping Regions</em>, including <strong>Geolocation</strong> and <strong>Country/Postcode Matching</strong> - a hugely flexible option which allows you to set up <em>shipping regions</em> quickly and easily by matching against the customer's postcode/zipcode etc.!</p>

	<p class="Note">With the extra <strong><a href="http://ceon.net/software/business/zen-cart/advanced-shipper-zones?doc=zc-um" target="_blank">Ceon Advanced Shipper Zones</a></strong> module, an additional option, <strong>Country/Zone Matching</strong>, can be used to match against addresses using Zen Cart <em>Zones</em>. Stores which already have a list of <em>Zones</em> set up for shipping purposes may find this module very handy indeed!</p>

	<p class="Note">Another expansion module, the <strong><a href="http://ceon.net/software/business/zen-cart/advanced-shipper-localities?doc=zc-um" target="_blank">Ceon Advanced Shipper Localities</a></strong> module, also adds additional options, <strong>Country/State Matching</strong> and <strong>Country/City Matching</strong>, which can be used to ensure that customers are only able to use a set list of <em>States</em>/<em>Areas</em>/<em>Cities</em>, thereby restricting shipping to places on that list - very useful for local delivery stores etc.!</p>


	<h3>Comprehensive Rate Definition Options</h3>
	<p><em>Shipping rates</em> are defined based on a combination of the customer's shipping address - the &ldquo;<em>Shipping Region</em>&rdquo; it is in - and the details for the <em>applicable products</em>; their total <strong>Weight</strong>, total <strong>Price</strong> or the <strong>Number of Items</strong> of applicable products, or the <strong>Total Order Price</strong> of <em>all</em> the <em>products</em> for an <em>order</em> (not just the total price of the applicable products for the method!).</p>

	<p>If rates have been defined for individual <em>products</em> and/or <em>categories</em> and/or <em>manufacturers</em>, the overall rate will be calculated based on the composition of their shopping cart.</p>

	<p>Rates can be entered as <strong>flat rates</strong>, <strong>percentage rates</strong>, a <strong>joint percentage rate &amp; flat rate</strong>, as a <strong>block rate</strong>, as a <strong>series of combination rates</strong> or in several other ways...</p>

	<p><strong class="FeatureTitle">Percentage Rates</strong> allow rates to be set up by <strong>weight</strong>/<strong>price</strong>/<strong>number of items</strong> quickly and easily, without having to enter long lists of <em>limits</em> &amp; <em>rates</em>!</p>
	
	<p class="Example">For Example, if a <em>shipping method</em> uses a courier service which charges by the Kg/lb, a &pound;1.25/Kg (or $1.25/lb) charge could be applied with the following rate definition:
		<br /><br />&lt;weight&gt;*:125%&lt;/weight&gt;
		<br /><br />For a 3.00Kg/lb order, this would be calculated as 125% x 3.00 = 3.75.
	</p>
	
	<p><strong class="FeatureTitle">Block Rates</strong> provide for the charging of a set rate per &ldquo;block&rdquo; or <strong>part</strong> of a block of the <strong>weight</strong>/<strong>price</strong>/<strong>number of items</strong>. The <strong>weight</strong>/<strong>price</strong>/<strong>number of items</strong> is divided up according to a &ldquo;block size&rdquo;, which is rounded up to the nearest whole number of blocks, and multiplied by the specified rate.</p>
	
	<p class="Example">For Example, if a <em>shipping method</em> uses a courier service which charges &pound;1.50 (or $1.50) for each 0.5Kg/lb or part thereof, the following rate definition could be used:
		<br /><br />&lt;weight&gt;*:[0.5:1.50]&lt;/weight&gt;
		<br /><br />For a 1.25Kg/lb order, this would be calculated as 3 x 1.50 = 4.50.
	</p>
	
	<p><strong class="FeatureTitle">Combination Rates</strong> allow orders to be priced using multiple rates at the same time!</p>
	<p class="Example">For Example, the same bookcase as above could be sent for an International Order by a <em>method</em> which uses a <em>combination rate</em> that charges more per Kg for the first 10Kg than the second:
		<br /><img src="_images/advanced-shipper-screenshots/combination-rate-example.png" alt="Example of Combination Rate being applied to a 20Kg product at checkout." class="ExampleScreenshot NoMarginBottom" /></p>
	
	<p><strong class="FeatureTitle">Minimum/Maximum Rates</strong> make setting up rates even simpler by allowing the specification of a <strong>minimum</strong> or <strong>maximum</strong> rate to be applied to any rate calculation. For example, it's easy to state that a rate should be based on a percentage of the weight of the applicable products in the cart, but should cost a <em>minimum</em> amount. This works independently of any <em>surcharge</em> which can also be added on!</p>
	
	<p><strong class="FeatureTitle">Nested Tables of Rates</strong> - Ceon Advanced Shipper even allows <strong>multiple calculation methods</strong> to be used per individual <em>shipping method</em>! A <strong>very</strong> powerful option which allows ever more flexible shipping rate rules to be set up. For example:</p>
	<p class="Example">&lt;price&gt;0-250: &lt;weight&gt;0-10: 2.50, 10-30: 4.50&lt;/weight&gt;, 250-*: 0.00&lt;/price&gt;
		<br /><br />For orders less than &pound;250 in value, shipping for orders weighing 0-10Kg will cost &pound;2.50 and for orders weighing 10-30Kg it will cost &pound;4.50.
		<br /><br />For orders over &pound;250, shipping will be free.
	</p>
	
	<p><strong class="FeatureTitle">UPS Rates Calculator</strong> - This can be used to have the module contact UPS for a custom set of shipping quotes for the applicable products. The <em>Source Country</em> and <em>Source Zipcode/Postcode</em> configuration options for each <em>region</em> of each <em>method</em> mean that it is easy to set up <strong>drop-shipping using UPS</strong> directly from a manufacturer or distribution centre etc., even for individual products/categories/manufacturers!</p>
	
	<p><strong class="FeatureTitle">USPS Rates Calculator</strong> - This can be used to have the module contact USPS for a custom set of shipping quotes for the applicable products. The <em>Source Country</em> and <em>Source Zipcode/Postcode</em> configuration options for each <em>region</em> of each <em>method</em> mean that it is easy to set up <strong>drop-shipping using USPS</strong> directly from a manufacturer or distribution centre etc., even for individual products/categories/manufacturers!</p>
	
	<p><strong class="FeatureTitle">FedEx Rates Calculator</strong> - This can be used to have the module contact FedEx for a custom set of shipping quotes for the applicable products. The <em>Source Country</em> and <em>Source Zipcode/Postcode</em> configuration options for each <em>region</em> of each <em>method</em> mean that it is easy to set up <strong>drop-shipping using FedEx</strong> directly from a manufacturer or distribution centre etc., even for individual products/categories/manufacturers!</p>

	<p><strong class="FeatureTitle">Contact Store Message Rates</strong> can be used instead of a numerical rate for individual <em>methods</em>, to <strong>prevent customers from checking out</strong> with the particular item(s) they have in their cart and instead have the module display a message. (For example, a message such as <em>&ldquo;Please contact the store for a personal shipping arrangement&rdquo;</em> could be displayed).</p>
	<p>This is a very handy option to have for awkward products/categories/manufacturers, or even to place limits on the number of a items a customer can order etc. (E.g. &ldquo;To order more than 50 units please contact us for a special shipping arrangement&rdquo;).</p>
	
	<p><strong class="FeatureTitle">Contact Store After Order Message Rates</strong> can be used to allow customers to check out with the particular item(s) they have in their cart but also to request that they <em>&ldquo;Contact the store for a personal shipping arrangement after completing your order&rdquo;</em> - so no potential sales are lost but the customer is still kept informed!</p>
	
	<p><strong class="FeatureTitle">Individual Rates Per Product</strong> - Ceon Advanced Shipper can even link to the products database to look up a rate for each applicable product. This allows the store to have specific rates for specific products! Multiple rates per product are supported, so it's possible to assign different rates to different delivery regions. (The individual rates should simply have been entered in a custom field in the products table).</p>

	<h3>Multiple Packages Support</h3>
	<p>If there is a <strong>maximum weight</strong> of applicable products which can be sent in a single package, and the ability to split the order into multiple packages is available to the store, the weight at which the products will be split into another package can be specified.</p>
	<p>Ceon Advanced Shipper will automatically work out how to combine the applicable products into the least number of individual packages possible. It will also take into account any packaging weight that must be added on per package!</p>


	<h3>Packaging Weights</h3>
	<p>For rates being calculated using the <strong>weight</strong> of the applicable products, a table of <strong>packaging weights</strong> to be added on to the weight of the applicable products - before the rate for the weight is calculated - can be specified.</p>
	<p>In a similar fashion to the rates themselves, the additional <em>packaging weights</em> can be specified using flat weights, percentage weights, flat &amp; percentage weights, block weights or combination weights!</p>
	
	
	<h3>Surcharges/Discounts</h3>
	<p>As if all of that wasn't enough, an additional <strong>surcharge</strong>, or a <strong>discount</strong> against the calculated shipping rate, can also be specified for <strong>each</strong> individual shipping method/region!</p>
	<p>It is <strong>simple</strong> to <strong>add on charges for insurance</strong> (for example, based on the total price of the products), to <strong>add on a charge for handling a large order</strong> (for example, one having several packages) etc. or to <strong>apply a discount to the calculated shipping rate</strong> (for example, to reduce the rate returned by UPS/USPS by a certain percentage).</p>
	<p>The surcharge/discount can be a simple flat rate, or can use its own, <strong>full table of rates</strong>, based on the total <strong>Price</strong> or the <strong>Number of Items</strong> of the applicable products, the <strong>Total Order Price</strong> of all products in the order (not just the total price of the applicable products for the method), the <strong>Shipping Rate</strong> calculated for the method, the total <strong>Weight</strong> of all the packages calculated for the method (all the applicable products plus the packaging) or the <strong>Number of Packages</strong> being used to ship the applicable products by this method!</p>

	<h3>Method Availability Scheduling &amp; Shipping Scheduling</h3>
	<p>Individual shipping methods can be set to be <strong>valid only for certain time periods</strong>, or a <strong>preferred shipping date</strong> (or selection of shipping dates) can be offered to the customer!</p>
	
	<p class="Example">For example, a &ldquo;Saturday Delivery&rdquo; Method could be configured to be available from Thursdays (at 16:00) until Fridays (at 16:00).
	<br />
	<br />The Shipping Method would then only be available as an option from 4PM on Thursday afternoon until 4PM on Friday afternoon.</p>
	
	<p class="Example">An example of offering a selection of shipping dates:
		<br /><img src="_images/advanced-shipper-screenshots/recurring-methods-example.png" alt="Example of Offering Shipping Scheduling." class="ExampleScreenshot NoMarginBottom" /></p>

	<p>In addition, it is also possible to set a <strong>limit on the number of orders which can make use of a particular shipping method</strong> within its availability period.</p>
	
	<p class="Example">For example, any stores offering delivery services can stop taking orders for Saturday delivery after the 20th order has come in!</p>
	
	<h3>Full Tax Support</h3>
	<p>Each Region can have its own &ldquo;<em class="ConfigurationOption">Tax Class</em>&rdquo; setting and rates can be entered <strong>including</strong> or <strong>excluding</strong> tax, with an independent &ldquo;<em class="ConfigurationOption">Rates Include Tax</em>&rdquo; setting able to be configured for <strong>each</strong> Region for a Shipping Method.</p>

	<h3>Intuitive Admin Configuration Utility</h3>
	<p>It would be impossible to offer all the options that the Ceon Advanced Shipper module does using the standard Zen Cart configuration shipping module procedures so a complete Configuration Utility has been built from the ground up.</p>

	<p>The JavaScript-powered Configuration Utility makes it easy to add, configure and delete <em>Shipping Method Configurations</em>, <em>Product/Category/Manufacturer Selections</em> and <em>Region Configurations</em>.</p>

	<div id="advanced-shipper-localities-desc" class="NoscriptAndPrintOutputBlock">
	
	<p>The Ceon Advanced Shipper Localities module is an extension to the Ceon Advanced Shipper 6 module which allows store owners to set up a list of <em class="ConfigurationOption">States</em> (e.g. &ldquo;California&rdquo;, &ldquo;Florida&rdquo; etc.), <em class="ConfigurationOption">Areas</em> (e.g. &ldquo;L.A. Metropolitan Area&rdquo;, &ldquo;North California&rdquo; etc.) and <em class="ConfigurationOption">Towns/Cities</em> (e.g. &ldquo;Los Angeles&rdquo;, &ldquo;Long Beach&rdquo; etc.) for a <em>country</em>, which customers can use when they create an account on the site or add an address to their address book.</p>

	<p>Specific <em>shipping methods</em> can be made available to a <em>State</em>/<em>Area</em>/<em>City</em> quickly and easily by choosing the <em class="ConfigurationOption">Country</em> and <em class="ConfigurationOption">State</em>/<em class="ConfigurationOption">Area</em>/<em class="ConfigurationOption">City</em> to which the shipping method applies in the Ceon Advanced Shipper Configuration Utility.</p>
	
	<p>The <em class="ConfigurationOption">&ldquo;Terms&rdquo;</em> used for each <em class="ConfigurationOption">&ldquo;Locality&rdquo;</em> can be changed to a store's preferences (e.g. instead of &ldquo;State/Area/City&rdquo;, it could be &ldquo;Province/County/City&rdquo;).</p>
	
	<p>The module <strong>fully supports JavaScript remote loading</strong> so that, as a customer selects a <em>State</em>/<em>Area</em>, a dynamic list of <em>Cities</em> within that <em>Area</em>/<em>State</em> are displayed and able to be selected - <strong>there's no clicking &ldquo;Next&rdquo; and waiting on page reloads!</strong></p>
	
	<p class="Example">For Example, the counties of Northern Ireland, with an <em class="ConfigurationOption">area</em> &ldquo;Greater Belfast&rdquo; of &ldquo;County Antrim&rdquo; would appear as follows:
		<br /><img src="_images/advanced-shipper-localities-screenshots/state-selection-example.png" alt="Example of State/Sub-locality Selection on the Create Account page." class="ExampleScreenshot" />
		<br />Selecting &ldquo;Greater Belfast&rdquo; would display the <em class="ConfigurationOption">towns/cities</em> defined for that <em class="ConfigurationOption">area</em>:
		<br /><img src="_images/advanced-shipper-localities-screenshots/city-selection-example.png" alt="Example of City Selection on the Create Account page." class="ExampleScreenshot" />
	</p>
	
	<p>Now it couldn't be easier to limit shipping <strong>only</strong> to places the store actually ships, thereby avoiding unfulfilled, refunded or cancelled orders!</p>

	<p>Of course, for 100% compatibility, the module <strong>fully supports any browser that doesn't have JavaScript enabled</strong> so every customer will find it easy to sign up or add an address!</p>

	<p>The <a href="http://ceon.net/software/business/zen-cart/advanced-shipper/demo?doc=zc-um" target="_blank">Ceon Advanced Shipper demo</a> has this module installed... try it out!</p>

	<p class="Note NoMarginBottom"><strong>Please note:</strong> Ceon Advanced Shipper 6 Localities is <strong>not</strong> likely to be upgraded to be compatible with Zen Cart 2.0.x, it is for <strong>1.2.x/1.3.x/1.5.x only</strong>.</p>

		<li>Ceon Product Variants massively improves Zen Cart's products system, making it easier for customers to pick the specific product they want to buy.</li>
		<li>
			<p>Customers can buy exactly what they want with one click!

			<p>With Ceon Product Variants the form is made dynamic, so as the user selects different options, the price, image, stock level info etc. are all updated on the page straight away - <strong>there is no longer a need to add a product to the cart to see the price!</strong></p>

	<p>Stores wishing to accept cards online through Sage Pay only need to <a href="https://support.sagepay.com/apply/default.aspx?PartnerID=7BC749E2-E05D-4F9C-8C55-8E9D04BCAF07" target="_blank">sign up for a Sage Pay Go account</a> and to link it with a merchant account. (If the store doesn't yet have a merchant account, Sage Pay can provide a good deal with their partners, Bank of Scotland!).</p>
	<p>Once the store has a Sage Pay Go account, it then has three options for taking payment via Sage Pay at checkout time, each of which has its unique plus points, and all of which have been specifically tailored to Zen Cart by Ceon.

	<h4>Streamlined Checkout Process</h4>
	
	<ul class="BulletedList TighterList">
		<li>We think that <strong><a href="http://ceon.net/software/business/zen-cart/sage-pay-direct?doc=zc-um">Ceon Sage Pay Direct</a></strong> is the best solution, as the customer remains on the store's website, they are not redirected to an external site to enter their details as with many other payment solutions, making this <strong>as professional a payment solution as you could possibly use with Zen Cart</strong>!</li>
		<li>The whole checkout process is completely streamlined, allowing store owners to have a store which works just as well as any of the large e-commerce websites - including <strong>full 3D-Secure support</strong> using slick IFrame technology.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h4>Transaction Admin</h4>
	
	<ul class="BulletedList">
		<li>
			<h1 class="ExtraEmphasis">Manage transactions directly within Zen Cart!</h1>
			<p>All our Sage Pay modules come with a fantastic Transaction Admin, which integrates fluidly with the Zen Cart admin orders page, enabling stores to carry out many &ldquo;Transaction Actions&rdquo; <strong>directly within the Zen Cart admin</strong>:</p>
			<ul class="BulletedList NoMarginBottom">
				<li>Deferred transactions can be partially or fully <em>Released</em> or <em>Aborted</em>.</li>
				<li>Authenticated transactions can be partially or fully <em>Authorised</em>, or <em>Cancelled</em>.</li>
				<li>Orders which used &ldquo;Immediate Charge&rdquo; or &ldquo;Deferred&rdquo; can be <em>Refunded</em> in full or in part, or, if not yet settled, <em>Voided</em>. (At this time, Authenticated transactions can only be refunded through My Sage Pay).</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>With all of the transaction actions, the <strong>Zen Cart totals</strong> for the order can be <strong>automatically updated</strong>, as can the overall Zen Cart order status - <span class="Underlined">a level of integration never before seen in Zen Cart</span>!</li>
		<li>
			<p><strong>Most stores should never need to use My Sage Pay again!</strong> The transaction admin is <span class="Underlined">almost a complete replacement for My Sage Pay</span>, having a live connection to Sage Pay which enables even more features:</p>
			<ul class="BulletedList NoMarginBottom">
				<li>Display of &ldquo;The 3rd Man&rdquo; fraud results for transactions.</li>
				<li>Display of the up-to-the-moment status of transactions.</li>
				<li>Automatic syncing of information about any transaction actions that have been performed against the initial transaction.</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h4>Easier PCI Compliance/Setup</h4>
	
	<ul class="BulletedList TighterList">
		<li>The <strong><a href="http://ceon.net/software/business/zen-cart/sage-pay-server?doc=zc-um">Ceon Sage Pay Server</a></strong> and <strong><a href="http://ceon.net/software/business/zen-cart/sage-pay-form?doc=zc-um">Ceon Sage Pay Form</a></strong> modules both offer easier PCI compliance as the card details are handled on Sage Pay's PCI Level 1 Compliant server - the store never comes in contact with them.</li>
		<li>Server is a little bit a nicer for the customer than Form, as Server uses IFrame technology, to allow the store to give the impression that the customer is staying on the store's website, whereas with Form the customer is redirected to Sage Pay's server.</li>
		<li>Form is even simpler to set up than Direct or Server as no SSL certificate is required for it.</li>
