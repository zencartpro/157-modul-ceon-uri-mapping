 * Initialize script to inject modification of the currency information for Ceon URI Mapping after includes/init_includes/init_currencies.php
 * has performed its operations, but before the next software may use that information.  Expected to load shortly after
 * includes/init_includes/init_currencies.php which has had a load point of 120 as identified in includes/auto_loaders/config.core.php.
 * This appears that it can be applied to all versions of Zen Cart.
